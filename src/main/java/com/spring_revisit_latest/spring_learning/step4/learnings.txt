Wiring of Beans
Wiring of Beans refers to when we want to establish a "has-a" relationship between two beans programmatically.
Ex: Shown in WiringConfig class

Spring guarantees that dependencies are resolved before a bean is created
1) In the example for WiringConfig. This is the process flow:
when Spring encounters a @Configuration class it creates a CGLIB proxy. This proxy ensures that if any method within the
configuration class calls another method that is annotated with @Bean, Spring does not execute the method directly but
checks the Spring context first to see if the bean has already been created.
2) By Default Spring creates all the Beans eagerly and not lazily unless they are explicitly marked with @Lazy.
3) Order of Bean Creation:
  3.1) When the Spring container initializes, it will start by processing the beans one by one.
  3.2) If Spring decides to create the Car bean (createCar()) first, it will notice that the Car bean requires an Engine.
       At this point, it will call createEngine() to ensure the engine bean is created and available for injection.
  3.3) If Spring creates the Engine bean (createEngine()) first, then it will simply store it in the context and reuse
       it when the Car bean is being created.

4) So, in practice, Spring will make sure that by the time the Car is created, the Engine bean is already available,
regardless of which method is called first internally

Auto-wiring of Beans
Auto-wiring of Beans refers to when we instruct spring to establish the "has-a" relationship between two beans. Spring will
automatically do it using Dependency injection.

Dependency Injection:
Dependency Injection is a design pattern where the responsibility of creating objects is transferred from the class itself
to an external framework like Spring. Instead of a class creating its own dependencies (objects it needs to function),
those dependencies are "injected" into the class by the framework.
Eg: Imagine a car that needs an engine to work. Instead of the car building the engine itself, it’s provided with an engine,
allowing the car to focus on its behaviours like Driving etc.

Dependency Injection using Parameter
Example Shown in DiWithParameterConfig.
Here we are instructing Spring to take the Parameter(Engine) from the context and inject it in the bean.
In our example we only have one engine in the application context but if they are multiple engine then we will have to
either use Qualifier or Primary annotation to resolve this issue.
Eg: @Bean(value="maruti")
    Car createCar(@Qualifier("marutiEngine") Engine engine) {
        Car car = new Car();
        car.setBrand("MARUTI");
        car.setEngine(engine);
        return car;
    }

    Using Primary annotation
    @Bean(value="marutiEngine")
    @Primary
    Engine createEngine() {
        Engine engine = new Engine();
        engine.setEngineModelNo(124);
        return engine;
    }

    @Bean(value="hondaEngine")
    Engine createAnotherEngine() {
        Engine engine = new Engine();
        engine.setEngineModelNo(456);
        return engine;
    }

If there are multiple beans of the same type in the context, and we fail to specify which context we want spring to inject
then Spring will throw NoUniqueBeanDefinitionException.
DI on parameter is still better than the wiring beans by ourselves approach as if there are multiple beans of same type
then the wiring beans approach will not work as there we are just invoking the function.

Dependency injection using Autowired
1) Auto-wiring using field injection
Here Spring will inject the field by internally using Java Reflection.
Eg: AutoWiringConfig class and CarWithFieldInjection. Engine is injected into the Car with field injection
Usually this approach is not preferred because of lack of immutability. We can't use @Autowired and final keyword
at the same time if we are not initialising the object. This can only be possible if we are initialising it in
constructor that is constructor injection approach.

Wiring of Beans and Creation of Beans should be treated separately
Explanation: Don't have this confusion that @Autowired annotation can be used only with Stereotype annotations.
Autowired annotation is a way using which Spring is auto-establishing relationship between two beans. Spring only
cares about that the bean which has to be autowired should be present in its context. It doesn't concern with how
that bean was put in the context whether through Bean annotation, Stereotype annotation or through Register Bean method.
See example: CarWithFieldInjection don't have any stereotype annotation, but we are using Autowired annotation there.

2) Auto-wiring using setter injection
Here Spring will inject the value in the parameter of the Setter method annotated with @AutowiredAnnotation, and then
we can write our business logic and can manipulate the parameter as per our need.
IMP: Spring will only inject it in the parameter of the setter method and not actually on the attribute/field of the instance.

3) Auto-wiring using Constructor Injection
Here Spring will inject the value in the constructor parameter, and then we can write our business logic and manipulate as
per our need.
IMP: Spring will only inject it in the parameter of the constructor
If there is only one constructor available then we don't even have to write Autowired annotation.
This approach has benefits:
1)Since we don't have to write Autowired annotation over constructor, now we can easily do unit testing. Tests are independent
and completely detached from the Framework.
Without @Autowired, constructors are plain Java constructors, and you can easily instantiate the class with its dependencies
manually in your unit tests without needing Spring’s context or dependency injection framework.
This allows you to use mock objects (e.g., using Mockito) or stubs for dependencies in your unit tests, making the testing
process much more lightweight and independent of the Spring framework.

2) If @Autowired is used, your unit tests might require some Spring-specific configuration or annotations (e.g., @RunWith(SpringJUnit4ClassRunner.class),
@ContextConfiguration) to wire up the dependencies, which can clutter the test code and make it more complex.
   Avoiding @Autowired on constructors means your test code stays clean, with no reliance on the Spring testing framework
   unless absolutely necessary.

3)Since we have this flexibility we can easily use Lombok and remove a lot of boilerplate. Previously it wasn't possible
using lombok and spring together to generate constructors. Writing autowired annotation requires constructor to be written
in the class.

Constructor injection with @Autowired approach is usually avoided with @Bean annotation combination
For eg: check not preferred way package. In the NotPreferredWiringConfig we are creating two beans NotPreferred Car and Engine.
Now If we try to use Constructor Injection then Constructor will always be parameterised. If Constructor is parameterised
then using @Bean annotation we have to use the parameterised constructor as well and to pass the dependency we have to use
Dependency Injection using Parameter.
Although this way will also work, but it is not that readable since, although we are using Autowired annotation but that is
not required since spring is wiring the Engine dependency in the wiring config class itself.
From Spring 4.3 if a class only have one constructor then we don't have to write Autowired annotation over it.

How Stereotype annotation works behind the scenes??
Component Scanning: Spring scans for classes annotated with @Component (or its variants like @Service, @Repository, @Controller).
Bean Definition Registration: Spring registers these classes as beans in the application context.
Dependency Injection: Spring resolves and injects dependencies (via constructor, setter, or field injection).
Bean Instantiation: Spring instantiates the bean when required (typically eagerly for singletons).
Proxy Creation (if applicable): For beans needing transactions, AOP, etc., Spring creates proxies to handle those concerns.
Bean Lifecycle Management: Spring manages the lifecycle of the bean, from initialization to destruction.

Handling Circular Dependencies
Best way is to redesign the code. This is the ultimate way.
Other possible solutions:
1) Not using constructor injection and using field,setter injection
Circular dependencies usually arise when using constructor injection, as Spring tries to instantiate the beans and inject
dependencies at the same time, leading to a cycle it cannot break.
In Field Injection: Spring handles the lifecycle of the beans and injects them once the beans are created.
In Setter Injection: setter injection allows Spring to first create the beans independently, and then resolve the dependencies
in a second phase, avoiding the circular reference problem.
