Spring is an application framework.
An application framework is a set of common functionalities that are provided by default to its user and gives
foundation structure for developing an application.
It eases out a lot of aspects and provides the solution of already existing problems like security, or we can say that
it eases out the effort of writing a new application and assists the devs in focusing more on the business logic.

Eg: Consider buying a bench from Amazon they will give you all the parts to make the bench. Now whether you want to
use certain parts to make it an incline bench, decline bench or a flat bench it's up to you. Application framework
works in the same way, it gives you a broad level of functionalities to build an application. It's up to devs to choose
the right parts of the framework and build the business application on top of the application framework.

Advantages of Application Framework:
1) Assists in focusing more on business logic by almost removing the common challenges faced by most of the business applications
for eg: Most business application uses similar way of communication, most business application uses similar way to increase
performance like Caching etc. Most applications needs similar mechanism against common vulnerabilities.

Inversion of Control
It is based on principle that framework  has the control for the dependencies and framework takes control of it and not the application/user.

IOC is a concept, and it's implementation is Dependency Injection and Aspects

Spring modules can be used standalone as well. For eg: If we want only application context we can include only dependency for it.
